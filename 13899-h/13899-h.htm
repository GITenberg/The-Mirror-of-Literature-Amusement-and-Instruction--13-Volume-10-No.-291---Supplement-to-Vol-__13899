    <h2>PREFACE.</h2>

    <p>Each volume of a successful periodical miscellany resembles
    Seneca's "one good turn&mdash;a shoeing-horn to another;" and
    the Editor of THE MIRROR, in prefacing his <i>tenth volume</i>
    with this comparison, hopes that he does not over-rate what the
    present patronage of the public encourages him to expect.
    Indeed, he would fear the suspicion of ingratitude on his part,
    were he not thus to acknowledge the long-extended success which
    has attended his labours, from their commencement to the
    present moment. At the same time, lest vanity should be thought
    to have mastered his better judgment, he assures his patrons
    that he does not claim the undivided merit of his good fortune;
    since, beyond his own taste of adaptation and selection, he
    "misses nothing he can fairly lay his hands on;" so that, the
    multiplicity of his resources being considered, his success is,
    perhaps, more complimentary to the discernment of the public,
    than it is laudatory of his individual exertions.</p>

    <p>As many readers would yawn over a long preface like so much
    Latin, the Editor will not, in the present instance, subject
    them to so extraordinary a stretch of <i>ennui</i>, by any
    lengthy comment on the character of his last volume. He hopes
    that its contents will be found equal to either of its
    predecessors; and, if any superiority be observed, he begs that
    it may be attributed to the "march of mind," in whose rank and
    file he may be allowed his proper order.</p>

    <p>Like the well-graced actor, who, at the conclusion of a
    play, bows to the performers before he addresses the audience,
    the Editor first returns his acknowledgments to his several
    Correspondents, who <i>have contributed</i> to the public
    entertainment in his last volume: perhaps this class may be
    very small, although in the usual proportion of good and evil
    which is scattered up and down all paths of life. To the other
    and more numerous class, <i>viz.</i> those whose Communications
    (from various motives, generally explained) have not been
    inserted, the Editor is equally indebted,&mdash;for intention,
    if not accomplishment; and he hopes that the performance of his
    critical duty has been such as to conciliate their respect and
    good-will. As a pleasantry, he would remind a fair proportion
    of his readers, that,</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i6">As the young and forward bud</p>

            <p>Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,</p>

            <p>Even so by love the young and tender wit</p>

            <p>Is turned to folly; blasting in the bud,</p>

            <p>Losing his verdure even in the prime,</p>

            <p>And all the fair effects of future hopes&mdash;</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>for he would not affect the fickle guide on so extended a
    scale. For graver matters, or such as are beyond the surface of
    the heart, <span class="pagenum">[pg iv]</span> the Editor
    thanks his Correspondents on subjects of <i>Art</i>, in its
    antiquarian and modern departments, of whose researches he has
    frequently availed himself. With a view to keep pace with the
    Spirit of Philosophical Discovery which characterizes the
    present day, the Editor has been his own Prometheus in
    introducing his readers to the "<i>Arcana of Science</i>," the
    object of which has already been fully explained, and he hopes,
    to a certain extent, realized.</p>

    <p>The Editor is not disposed to indulge too freely in
    anticipation, lest he should lose sight of his object:
    accordingly, he must be brief in his professions for the
    future. Improvement is contemplated in the general execution of
    the Embellishments, as far as the Proprietor and Editor have
    control; but, anon, they will be at the bar of public taste. To
    use a parliamentary phrase, other new "features" will be
    introduced from time to time, so as to continue to reflect in
    THE MIRROR the characteristics and curiosity of the present
    day, aided by some of the bright lights of past ages.</p>

    <p>The recent appointment of the above illustrious individual
    to the head of our naval administration is a gratulatory topic
    for every Englishman; and we doubt not the measure will
    contribute as largely to individual honour, as it will to the
    national welfare. In the abstract, nations resemble large
    families, of which kings are fathers or guardians; and the
    subdivision of this guardianship or paternal government, among
    the sons or younger brothers of the sovereign is calculated to
    promote unanimity among the governors, and to engraft with
    affectionate loyalty the hearts of the governed. Indeed, the
    tutelar presence of princes seldom fails to inspire courage,
    and to support the patriotic sons of arms even in the extremes
    of danger; and, although the princes of our times have seldom
    been distinguished in the camp of war,&mdash;we should
    recollect that</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Nihil sunt foris arma nisi est consilium domi.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The DUKE of CLARENCE, who is next brother to his present
    Majesty, was born at St. James's Palace, August 21, 1765, at a
    quarter before four in the morning, and in the following month
    was baptized by the name of WILLIAM HENRY. It is said that in
    his childhood and youth, it was the frankness of his
    countenance and behaviour induced the king to devote him to the
    naval service: added to this, he surpassed his brothers in
    corporeal strength and constitutional hardihood; although he
    was exceeded by them in the more refined acquirements of study,
    to which he manifested comparative indifference. With a mind
    naturally framed for peril and enterprise, and aware of the
    subordinate rank and laborious stations through which he must
    pass to distinction, he appears to have been enthusiastic and
    impatient for the service long before he entered the lists,
    notwithstanding he commenced his career at the age of fourteen,
    by joining the Prince George, a ninety-eight-gun ship, recently
    built, and named after his present majesty. In this ship, under
    the command of Admiral Digby, his royal highness bore a part in
    the great naval engagement between the English and Spanish
    fleets, commanded by Admiral Rodney and Don Juan de Langara.
    Previous to his leaving the Prince George, he was also present
    at the capture of a French man-of-war and three smaller
    vessels, forming part of a considerable convoy; but in neither
    of these instances was an opportunity offered for any
    distinguishing effort of bravery. On this occasion, the Spanish
    admiral, Don Juan de Langara, on visiting Admiral Digby, was
    introduced to his royal highness. During the conference between
    the two admirals the prince retired, and when it was intimated
    that Don Juan wished to return, his royal highness appeared in
    the uniform of a midshipman, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageii"
       id="pageii"></a>[pg ii]</span> respectfully informed the
       admiral that the boat was ready. The Spaniard was surprised
       to see the son of his Britannic majesty acting in the
       capacity of an inferior officer, and emphatically observed
       to Admiral Digby, "Well does Great Britain merit the empire
       of the seas, when humble stations in her navy are filled by
       princes of the blood."</p>

    <p>We have next the pleasing duty of adverting to two signal
    exertions of his royal highness in the cause of
    humanity&mdash;conduct which</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p class="i10">is twice bless'd:</p>

            <p>It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes:</p>

            <p>'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes</p>

            <p>The throned monarch better than his crown.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The first is thus narrated by a midshipman of the Torbay, in
    a letter to his friends:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"<i>Port Royal Harbour, April</i>, 1783.</p>

        <p>"The last time Lord Hood's fleet was here, a
        court-martial was held on Mr. Benjamin Lee, midshipman, for
        disrespect to a superior officer, at which Lord Hood sat as
        president. The determination of the court was fatal to the
        prisoner, and he was condemned to death. Deeply affected as
        the whole body of the midshipmen were at the dreadful
        sentence, they knew not how to obtain a mitigation of it,
        since Mr. Lee was ordered for execution; while they had not
        time to make their appeal to the Admiralty, and despaired
        of success in a petition to Admiral Rowley. However, His
        Royal Highness generously stepped forth, drew up a
        petition, to which he was the first to set his name, and
        solicited the rest of the midshipmen in port to follow his
        example. He then himself carried the petition to Admiral
        Rowley, and in the most pressing and urgent manner, begged
        the life of our unhappy brother; in which he succeeded, and
        Mr. Lee is reprieved. We all acknowledge our warmest and
        grateful thanks to our humane, our brave, and worthy
        prince, who has so nobly exerted himself in preserving the
        life of his brother sailor."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the same year, 1783, the prince, then a fine midshipman,
    visited Cape Francois, and the Havannah, where the second
    instance of his generous humanity occurred. It should be
    premised, that some of his countrymen having broken their oath
    of fidelity to the Spanish government, were in danger of
    suffering under sentence of death. The governor of Louisiana,
    Don Galvez, offered, at the intercession of the prince, to
    pardon them; and the enthusiasm which he manifested in this
    "labour of love" cannot be better illustrated than by the
    following letter addressed by his royal highness to the
    governor:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"Sir,&mdash;I want words to express to your Excellency
        my just sense of your polite letter, of the delicate manner
        in which you caused it to be delivered, and your generous
        conduct towards the unfortunate in your power. Their
        pardon, which you have been pleased to grant on my account,
        is the most agreeable present you could have offered me,
        and is strongly characteristic of the bravery and gallantry
        of the Spanish nation. This instance increases, if

        has appeared on so many occasions, in the course of the
        late war.</p>

        fully sensible of your Excellency's attention to me.</p>

    <p>On June 17, 1785, after a service afloat of six years and
    three months, his royal highness was promoted lieutenant of the
    Hebe. In ten months after this we find him serving as captain
    of the Pegasus; next in the Andromeda and the Valiant; and on
    December 3, 1790, his royal highness received a commission as
    rear-admiral of the blue, having then been about eighteen
    months a peer of England, Scotland, and Ireland, by the titles
    of duke of Clarence and St. Andrews, and earl of Munster. From
    this period till the year 1814 his royal highness remained on
    shore. On April 19, in that year, he hoisted his flag on board
    the Jason, as admiral of the fleet; and on the 23rd of the same
    month he sailed from Dover, with several other ships, to escort
    Louis XVIII. to the coast of France;
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiii"
       id="pageiii"></a>[pg iii]</span> and having seen him to
       Calais, returned to the Downs on the night of the 24th, and
       struck his flag a few days after.<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

    <p>During the period between the 25th of May and June 28th,
    1814, (when his royal highness finally took leave of the sea,)
    his flag was hoisted, successively, in the Impregnable and
    Jason, and again in the Impregnable, and from her transferred
    to the Magicienne; in which last ship he sailed on the 26th of
    June, and having escorted the allied sovereigns to the
    continent, struck his flag, and came on
    shore.<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

    <p>His royal highness' service at sea may, therefore, be stated
    as follows:&mdash;6 years as midshipman; 11 months as
    lieutenant; 3 years and 10 months as post captain; and 7 weeks
    as admiral of the fleet: making a total service at sea of about
    10 years and 9 months.<a id="footnotetag3"

    <p>The intimacy of the prince with the gallant Nelson is well
    known as one of the most interesting incidents of the duke's
    life. They first met at Quebec in 1782, when Nelson was in the
    Albemarle off that station, and whence he was ordered to convoy
    a fleet of transports to New York. From this time they became
    much attached, and their separation was the cause of mutual
    regret. At the close of the war they met again, both being
    appointed to the Leeward island station. Nelson soon had an
    opportunity of witnessing the prince's resolute obedience to
    orders, amidst great personal danger, and strong temptations to
    avarice, the circumstances of which are briefly as
    follow:&mdash;The law excluded all foreign vessels from trade
    and intercourse with our West India islands; and America, being
    now independent, and as much a foreign nation as any other,
    Nelson, the senior captain on the station, ordered all American
    vessels to quit the islands within forty-eight hours, on pain
    of seizure, and prosecution of their owners. Four vessels at
    Nevis remained, which he ordered to be searched, and on being
    found American, they were adjudged legal prizes. This
    proceeding placed Nelson in considerable difficulty, but he
    ultimately triumphed; and though the thanks of government for
    protecting its commerce were given to the admiral of the
    station, who had in fact opposed the measure, Nelson was
    conscious of having done his duty, and enjoyed the approbation
    of such as were disinterested witnesses of it. Among these was
    Prince William, who thus notices Nelson's conduct on this
    occasion in a letter to a friend: "It was at this era," says
    the prince, "that I particularly observed the greatness of
    Nelson's superior mind. The manner in which he enforced the
    spirit of the Navigation Act first drew my attention to the
    commercial interests of my country. We visited different
    islands together; and as much as the manoeuvres of fleets can
    be described off the headlands of islands, we fought over again
    the principal naval actions in the American war. Excepting the
    naval tuition which I had received on board the Prince George,
    when the present Rear Admiral Keats was lieutenant of her, and
    for whom we both entertained a sincere regard, my mind took its
    first decided naval turn from this familiar intercourse with
    Nelson."</p>

    <p>It is also worthy of remark, that while the prince spoke
    thus highly of Nelson, the latter estimated his royal highness
    in correspondent terms. In a letter to Captain Locker, about
    the same period, Nelson says, "You must have heard, long before
    this reaches you, that Prince William is under my command. I
    shall endeavour to take care that he is not a loser by that
    circumstance. He has his foibles as well as private men, but
    they are far overbalanced by his virtues. In his professional
    line he is superior to near two-thirds I am sure of the list;
    and in attention to orders, and respect to his superior
    officers, I hardly know his equal. His royal highness keeps up
    strict discipline in his ship, and without paying him any
    compliment, she is one of the finest ordered vessels I have
    seen." These opinions, it should be recollected, are quoted
    from private correspondence&mdash;a circumstance which adds
    materially to their value.</p>

    <p>On July 11, 1818, his royal highness was married at Kew to
    her serene <span class="pagenum"><a name="pageiv"
       id="pageiv"></a>[pg iv]</span> highness Adelaide Amelia
       Louisa Theresa Caroline, princess of Saxe Meinengen, eldest
       daughter of his serene highness the late reigning duke of
       Saxe Meinengen. The ceremony, as is usual on these
       occasions, was performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in
       the presence of all the royal family. By this marriage his
       royal highness had one daughter, who was born March 27,
       1819, and died after a few hours. In 1823, his royal
       highness was made a general of marines; and within the past
       year the duke has been appointed lord high admiral of
       England.</p>

    <p>It is not our intention here to enter into the supposed
    causes of the duke's long seclusion from public service, viz.
    from 1790 to the present time, except a short interval in 1814.
    At the commencement of the war with France, the late Duke of
    York took an early and active part by land; hence the question
    arises as to the non-appointment of the Duke of Clarence to a
    similar position by sea. The consequence has been, that the
    most vigorous portion of the duke's life has been lost to his
    country, whilst his royal highness has remained in comparative
    obscurity, amidst one of the most brilliant periods of our
    naval history. It is, however, gratifying to know that the
    duke's inactivity cannot be attributed to apathy on his part.
    On the contrary, he was anxious to be employed, and even sought
    appointment, as appears by the following letter, written by his
    royal highness to Commodore Owen in 1812:&mdash;</p>

    <p class="author">"<i>Bath House, Saturday night.</i></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"DEAR SIR&mdash;This evening I received your letter from
        Deal, and in answer to it, I beg to observe, that I have
        made both a public and private application to the king,
        that I may be permitted to hoist my flag, and relieve Lord
        Collingwood in the command of his majesty's fleet in the
        Mediterranean. There cannot be any secrecy in this thing;
        because, before more than fifty brother officers, I
        declared my resolution at Portsmouth. Until I have the
        order to hoist my flag, I cannot be certain; but I am very
        much inclined to think eventually that I shall have the
        honour and the happiness of commanding those fine fellows
        whom I saw in the spring in the Downs, and lately at
        Portsmouth. My short stay at Admiral Campbell's had
        impressed me with very favourable ideas of the improved
        state of the navy; but my residence at Portsmouth has
        afforded me ample opportunity of examining, and
        consequently of having a perfect judgment of the high and
        correct discipline now established in the king's service. *
        * * I could not resist what I felt; and reasons, both
        public and private, urged me to make the offer I have
        already mentioned, and I hope I shall be gratified.&mdash;I
        remain, dear sir, yours, &amp;c.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="author">"WILLIAM."</p>

    <p>These zealous sentiments are, however, further corroborated
    by a recent declaration of the duke to the Goldsmiths' Company,
    on their presenting him with the freedom of their society.</p>

    <p>Having sketched the principal circumstances which appertain
    to what may be termed the <i>public career</i> of his royal
    highness, it is our less pleasant, though equally important,
    duty, to notice his <i>domestic life</i>; for obvious reasons
    our details will be less perfect. It is a portion of the duke's
    life which cannot be entirely passed over in silence, since it
    must be conceded, that much of his unpopularity may be traced
    to this source. Neither the court nor the people of England are
    so ascetic as not to extenuate the indiscretions of royalty;
    but this charitable estimate of misgivings does not extend to
    approbation of any culpable dereliction of social and moral
    duties. The fact of his royal highness having a large family,
    by a lady now no more, is too well known to be concealed; but
    the odium attached to his royal highness for his participation
    in a certain scene of license and poverty, has doubtless been
    over-rated; but his proportion must be left for the biographer
    of a future age to settle; and we sincerely hope that, to quote
    a contemporary, "when the time arrives that the historian shall
    feel himself at liberty to enter into details, and sift matters
    to the bottom, his royal highness will come out of the
    investigation, (not without some blame, for which of us is
    faultless, but) with a character unsullied <i>even in this
    respect</i>, and in all other respects irreproachable." Mankind
    are, more or less, the children of error; but
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagev"
       id="pagev"></a>[pg v]</span> their propensity to exaggerate
       human frailty deserves to be reprobated for its cruelty and
       wickedness.</p>

    <p>The happy marriage of his royal highness, to which event we
    have already alluded, has, we trust, been the means of clearing
    away the prejudices which the duke's former conduct may have
    engendered.</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>There is a tide in the affairs of man,</p>

            <p>Which taken at the flood leads on to fortune.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This period of his royal highness' life has probably
    arrived, and his appointment to the important office of Lord
    High Admiral will doubtless accelerate the beneficial effect.
    The public are perhaps sanguine in their expectations; but from
    early and subsequent proofs of the duke's devotion and
    attachment to the service over which he now presides, we have
    reason to think they will not be disappointed. It has been
    shown that his royal highness neither wanted zeal nor ability
    at any stage of his life, and the ardent assurances which have
    been quoted from one of his most recent declarations, bespeak
    that he still possesses the vigour of manhood, tempered with
    experience; and it must be truly gratifying to his royal
    highness to know that the honour and authority of the office of
    Lord High Admiral, have been revived, after the sleep of a
    century, as if to compensate him for past neglect, with their
    investiture.<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
       In truth, the alacrity with which the duke has already
       entered into the duties of his office, and the lively sense
       of justice he has manifested in dispensing its honorary
       rewards, must be gladly hailed by the service, and the
       country at large.</p>

    <p>The Duke of York is acknowledged by Mr. Peel, in his speech,
    Feb. 17, 1827, to have had £50,000. a-year.</p>

    <p>We subjoin the following characteristic anecdote from the
    New Sailor's Magazine for December, 1827, sketched with
    fidelity and in that rich vein of humour by which stories of
    the service are usually distinguished. It exhibits the
    character of his royal highness in all the glowing generosity
    of buoyant youth, and proves him to possess a warm-hearted
    sympathy for the sufferings of his fellow-creatures&mdash;</p>

    <h3>THE ROYAL REEFER AND BOB CLEWLINES.</h3>

    <p>It was on one of those December days, when the wind, blowing
    from the northward, acts almost like a razor on the surface of
    the skin, and when, accompanied by small sharp rain, a mixture
    of damp and cold produce a chilling effect upon the frame and
    spirits, that a <i>ci-devant</i> midshipman, his hands in his
    pockets, and</p>

    <div class="poem">
        <div class="stanza">
            <p>"Whistling as he went for want of thought,"</p>
        </div>
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevi"
       id="pagevi"></a>[pg vi]</span>

    <p>crossed London-bridge, which at that time was an asylum to
    the footsore, the pauper, and the weary of heart. The day had
    fallen, and every thing looked dull and dreary; the foot-path
    was encumbered by mud, and porters carrying weights, as well as
    other busy passengers, were jostling each other to obtain a
    footing on the dirty pavement: a fellow heavy laden came in
    contact with the <i>royal reefer</i><a id="footnotetag6"
       name="footnotetag6"></a><a href="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a>
       so powerfully, that he took a lee-lurch, and got foul of one
       of the seats in the arches. "Avast there; luff up, you
       lubberly rigged son of a gun," cried middy; "couldn't you
       hail ship before you were aboard of us?" The fellow,
       however, waddled on; but the middy had to turn about in
       order to regain his course, when suddenly he beheld a
       middle-aged figure, perishing with cold, a red night-cap on,
       an old jacket and trousers, a pair of shoes in rags attached
       to his legs with a rope's end, no shirt, no stockings, nor
       any other attire; the face was climate-struck, it had braved
       the equator and the pole, the battle and the breeze, the
       scorching heat and the petrifying cold,&mdash;it was, as
       might be expected, thin, and moreover almost lost in a
       profusion of hair on each cheek, so that it would be
       difficult for the oldest acquaintance to recognise the
       features after long absence; nature had made the lips to
       smile, the eyes to beam in kindness, the fine high forehead
       to command respect; but time and hardships, disease and
       disappointment, had quenched the fire of the organ of sight
       and intelligence, the mirror of the soul,&mdash;had
       prematurely furrowed that front of honest English high
       spirit and candour, and had taught the lips to fall in
       dejection and the treasured silence of woe: upon the whole,
       the figure had something fierce in it, but it was truly
       manly; the warrior's arms were folded together, and his
       face, bent towards the ground, was still half up-turned, and
       seemed to say to rich merchants and venders passing by on
       foot and in carriages, "There ye are, ye liers upon beds of
       down, ye feeders upon the poor man's toil; often have you
       slept secure, and safely enjoyed your wealth, whilst poor
       Jack rode out the gale, hung on the rigging betwixt life and
       death, and endured the storm which held him every moment
       betwixt the chance of clinging to a fragment of the wreck
       and sinking into eternity: but, now the war is over,
       smart-money paid for a sharp wound, and neglect and
       oblivion, are the seaman's portion." The expression of his
       face and eyes seemed to speak thus; indeed, it spoke
       volumes; but its mute appeal was lost on the worldlings, who
       brushed by him, and who, bent on love of gain, scarcely were
       aware that their fellow-man was starving by their side, too
       feeble and too much an outcast to work, yet too proud to
       beg; the middy's heart, however, was of that texture that it
       leant towards a brother-sailor, meet him where it might, and
       he naturally looked round at poor Jack on his beam-ends: he
       had but one penny in his pocket, and that the plaintive
       voice of a blind woman had drawn, as if by magic, from its
       deep recess. What was to be done?&mdash;for he should have
       liked to have taken this wreck of <i>a man of war into
       tow</i>. The reflection caused him to examine more closely
       the shivering seaman, when a small scar, occasioned by a
       splinter, on the <i>bridge of the nose</i>, brought to his
       remembrance Bob <i>Clewlines</i>, who had served in the same
       ship: the tar recognised him also; but, so far from making
       himself known to him, he hid his face in his hand: the
       reefer, however, was resolved to bring him to. "What, Bob
       Clewlines!" cried he, "do I not hail an old shipmate in you,
       a quarter-master on board the &mdash;&mdash;, the bravest
       heart of oak, the best reefer, and the merriest steersman of
       the whole ship's crew; and," said he audibly, that every one
       passing might hear and value fallen courage and fidelity,
       "and <i>as prime a seaman as ever trimmed a sail, or served
       a gun</i>; why, what has broke up your old hulk this way?"
       The man could not find utterance; remembrance of
       <i>unrequited services</i> and other associations checked
       him. The middy stretched out his hand, which the
       <i>broken-hearted sailor</i> ventured not to take. "Come,
       Bob," cried the other, "no subordination now: we are
       <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagevii"
       id="pagevii"></a>[pg vii]</span> all equals on life's
       <i>quarter-deck</i>, and when my <i>fellow-man</i> suffers,
       he <i>rises</i> a peg in my estimation. Why?&mdash;because
       <i>unfeeling lubbers</i> slight him. Come tip us your
       <i>fin</i>. Your hand may be dirty, but your soul is as kind
       as a new sail in a sunny day. I'll show it against any
       lord's in the land. Come, heave a head; follow me, old tarry
       breeches; I'll soon set your <i>timbers</i> and
       <i>rigging</i> to rights; you shall have an entire refit.
       Come, bear a hand; <i>set</i> all your <i>canvass</i>; it's
       all in <i>ribbons</i>, I see, and <i>shivers</i> in the
       wind; but I'll keep out wind and weather for you."</p>

    <p>Thus saying, he walked proudly with the poor tar, astern of
    him, until he came to a slop-shop, near Wellclose square: it
    was a Jew's. "Here, Moses," quoth the middy, who detected the
    Israelite bending looks of disdain and mistrust on the poor
    man, as if he considered the contents of his shop in danger:
    "come, Moses, a regular built <i>outrig</i> for this
    <i>gentleman</i>," laying great stress on the word gentleman.
    This was <i>pitching</i> it strong, but his heart was carrying
    <i>royals, sky-scrapers, moon-rakers</i>, and his <i>pulse</i>
    was <i>sailing</i> at the rate of <i>ten knots</i> an hour at
    least; so elate was he to serve a brave man in distress, and
    above all, a son of the ocean: "come, let us have every thing
    good, and spic and span new."&mdash;"Pray, <i>Shair</i>, who's
    to pay?"&mdash;"<i>Myshelf.</i>"&mdash;"O, your honour, that's
    right." The poor man retired to a back-room, and stepped
    forward clad from head to foot, and with two changes of linen
    and a pair of shoes (by the midshipman's order) tied up in a
    pocket-handkerchief under his arm. BOB CLEWLINES looked with a
    blush on his old clothes, and at this moment an almost naked
    boy passed by: the midshipman duly appreciated and truly
    interpreted one look of the tar. "Bob, I say, heave that
    overboard, and let the poor boy pick it up: one good turn
    deserves another." The payment was the next. "Three pounds
    fifteen.&mdash;Is that the lowest?"&mdash;"O, yesh: I don't
    gain five shillings by the whole deal."&mdash;"Well, then, do
    you take the case of my gold watch, and weigh it, and give me
    the produce of it."&mdash;"Let ush see: it's vary pretty, but
    not vary heavy; it's all fashion you see: indeed, it's a great
    pity to part, the vatch and the caish; watches are a drug now,
    or else I'd buy it; but just to oblige you, I'll see what I can
    give."&mdash;"Don't trouble yourself, Mosey; just do as you are
    bid: you take the outside case, and I'll keep the
    watch."&mdash;"I shall lend you four pounds upon it," resumed
    the Israelite; "and you may depend upon my honour to return it
    to you, when you bringsh me de monish."&mdash;"No, you won't,
    Mosey; you'll do just what I bid you."&mdash;"It will spoil the
    watch"&mdash;"Not a bit; she must work without her
    <i>jacket</i>, as my friend has often done in all weathers. I
    shall sell the outside case to serve a shipmate in distress;
    but the watch was left me by a dear friend, so I shall keep
    her: a metal case will do as well for a little time, and when
    fortune's breeze springs up again, <i>the case will be
    altered</i>."&mdash;"Vel, shair, you shall be obeyed: five
    pounds, five shillings is just the price of the weight; there's
    the money."&mdash;"Good morning, Master Moses; but do you,
    <i>Clewlines</i>, set sail again; I want to get you into port:
    it is only what I owe you. Were you not the kindest creature to
    me in the world <i>when I was confined to my berth with the
    yellow fever, and not expected to live a day?</i> Come, come,
    you must take your cargo in; you must be <i>victualled</i> as
    well as <i>refitted</i>. I have got a chalk at a house near
    this,&mdash;another shipmate who is set up in business in a
    public line: call for what you want, and here's the loose
    change to keep your pocket until something turns up." Poor Bob
    got a <i>good dinner</i>, a <i>good bed</i>, and a <i>snug
    hammock</i>, that night; and shortly afterwards he obtained a
    birth in an Indiaman, and is now doing well. The royal reefer's
    heart bounded with joy at performing this noble action to
    recover which he put himself for a month on short allowance.
    But this is only one of many such traits in the character of
    this heart of oak whose name the writer could scarcely venture
    to state, but who will here remember this scene.</p>

    <p>given by the gentlemen of the Thames Yacht Club, in honour
    of his royal highness the Lord High Admiral having condescended
    to become the patron of the club, on Thursday September 27,
    1827. A steam packet was engaged, to accompany the match, by
    the Club for the accommodation of their friends, among whom we
    had the good fortune to be numbered. It was altogether a most
    grateful relaxation from our land labours. The distance sailed
    was from off Blackwall to Gravesend and back, and the muster of
    the fleet almost unprecedentedly fine. The whole of the vessels
    were admirably managed throughout, the match, which towards the
    close, became intensely interesting. At length it was decided
    by the <i>Lady Louisa</i>, (Mr. Thomas Smith, owner) arriving
    first at Blackwall, distancing eight others, but gaining the
    victory with only a few minutes to spare. If we recollect
    "right well," the day was fine for the advanced period of the
    season, and on board the several vessels packets, and on the
    banks of the river, there were the usual humours of an aquatic
    spectacle without any of its vulgarisms. The cup, weighing 85
    oz. and standing nearly two feet high, is of silver, elegantly
    chased, and as our engraving imports, of classical design; and
    its exhibition, with the customary ceremony of presentation,
    toasting, &amp;c. appeared to afford much satisfaction to the
    assembled company, and the victorious claimant of the prize,
    and equal credit to the taste of the artist, Mr. Hyams.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
